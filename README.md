# 2D-Demo
This project is very simple. You are a cube inside a canvas and you are able to move around using the arrow keys on your keyboard. There are some shapes on the screen that come together to form an abstract shape, as well as a background that i found on freeimages.com . 

## What I Learned
I learned how to create a basic "game" in Pygame using shapes, text, and user input. A lot of the commands I used relied on the x and y coordinates so I had to tinker with the screen size and boundaries a little to get things how I wanted. 

## Whats Needed to run this project
You are going to need the Pygame module for Python to run this program as it relies on Pygame. You are also going to need the "background.png" file because it is used in the game.
